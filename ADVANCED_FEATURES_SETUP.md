2. **Signed URLs** - Time-limited, secure access tokens
3. **Link Expiry** - Auto-expiring share links (7, 30, 90 days, etc.)
4. **Client Groups** - Organize clients for easy bulk sharing

## üìã Setup Steps

### Step 1: Install Required Dependencies

```bash
npm install nanoid
```

### Step 2: Update Database Schema

Run the Prisma migration to add all new tables:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_advanced_features
```

Or manually run the SQL if using Supabase directly (see `MIGRATION.sql` file).

### Step 3: Generate Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### Step 4: Environment Variables

Make sure you have these in your `.env`:

```env
# OpenRouter API for AI features
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here

# App URL for share links
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 5: Update Navigation

Add these new pages to your admin navigation:

```typescript
// In your navigation config
{
  title: "Client Groups",
  href: "/admin/client-groups",
  icon: Users,
},
{
  title: "Analytics",
  href: "/admin/analytics",
  icon: BarChart3,
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Share links not working?**
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set correctly
- Ensure token hasn't expired

**AI features not working?**
- Verify `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set
- Check API key has credits

**Analytics not showing?**
- Views/downloads only track after share links are used
- Direct file access doesn't increment counters

**Watermarks not visible?**
- Only works with PDF files
- Check watermark text is not empty
- Verify `watermark_enabled` is true in share
