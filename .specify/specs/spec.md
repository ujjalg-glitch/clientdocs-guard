# ClientDocs Guard - Project Specification

**Project**: ClientDocs Guard Document Management Platform  
**Created**: December 2024  
**Status**: In Development  
**Input**: Secure document sharing platform for professional services

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Document Upload and Organization (Priority: P1)

A professional (lawyer, consultant, accountant) needs to securely upload client documents and organize them for easy access and sharing.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that enables all other features. Without document upload, the platform has no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading various file types and verifying they are stored securely and accessible to the uploader.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they upload a PDF document, **Then** the file is stored securely and appears in their file list
2. **Given** a user with documents, **When** they view their files page, **Then** they see all their uploaded documents with metadata (size, date, type)
3. **Given** a user uploading a file, **When** the upload completes, **Then** they receive confirmation and can immediately access the document

### User Story 2 - Secure Document Sharing (Priority: P1)

A professional needs to share confidential documents with specific clients while maintaining control over access and usage.

**Why this priority**: Primary value proposition of the platform. Secure sharing is the core business need.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a share link and verifying the recipient can access the document with proper restrictions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with uploaded documents, **When** they share a document with a specific client, **Then** the client receives a secure link to access the document
2. **Given** a shared document, **When** the client accesses the link, **Then** they can view/download based on permissions set by the sharer
3. **Given** a shared document with expiry, **When** the expiry date passes, **Then** the link becomes invalid and access is denied

### User Story 3 - Client Group Management (Priority: P2)

A professional needs to organize clients into groups and share documents with entire groups efficiently.

**Why this priority**: Scales document sharing for professionals with multiple clients. Improves efficiency over individual sharing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a group, adding members, and sharing documents to the group.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with client contacts, **When** they create a client group, **Then** they can add clients to the group and manage membership
2. **Given** a client group, **When** a document is shared to the group, **Then** all group members receive access to the document
3. **Given** a group member, **When** they view their dashboard, **Then** they see documents shared to their groups

### User Story 4 - Access Control and Audit (Priority: P2)

A professional needs to track who accessed documents and maintain audit trails for compliance purposes.

**Why this priority**: Critical for professional services compliance and security. Provides accountability and transparency.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sharing a document and verifying that all access attempts are logged with timestamps and user information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a shared document, **When** someone accesses it, **Then** the access is logged with timestamp, user info, and action (view/download)
2. **Given** a document owner, **When** they view analytics, **Then** they see complete access history and statistics
3. **Given** an audit log, **When** compliance review occurs, **Then** complete access trail is available for review

### User Story 5 - Advanced Sharing Controls (Priority: P3)

A professional needs fine-grained control over document access including watermarks, download limits, and view-only mode.

**Why this priority**: Enhanced security and control features that differentiate the platform from basic file sharing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting various sharing restrictions and verifying they are enforced correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a document being shared, **When** watermark is enabled, **Then** downloaded documents include visible watermarks
2. **Given** a document with download limit, **When** limit is reached, **Then** further downloads are blocked
3. **Given** a view-only document, **When** recipient tries to download, **Then** download is prevented but viewing is allowed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to access an expired document?
- How does the system handle concurrent access to the same document?
- What happens when a group member is removed while documents are shared to the group?
- How does the system handle file corruption during upload?
- What happens when storage quota is exceeded?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authenticated users to upload documents up to 100MB
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate file types and prevent malicious file uploads
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to share documents with specific users or groups
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate secure, time-limited access tokens for shared documents
- **FR-005**: System MUST log all document access attempts with user, timestamp, and action
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to create and manage client groups with member roles
- **FR-007**: System MUST support document watermarks for shared files
- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce download limits and view-only restrictions
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide analytics and reporting on document usage
- **FR-010**: System MUST support role-based access control (Super Admin, Admin, User)

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents authenticated users with roles, preferences, and access permissions
- **Document**: Represents uploaded files with metadata, sharing settings, and access controls
- **ClientGroup**: Represents collections of users for efficient document sharing
