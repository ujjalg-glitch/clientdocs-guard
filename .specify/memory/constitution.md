# ClientDocs Guard Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Security-First Architecture
Every feature MUST prioritize security and data protection. All document sharing, user authentication, and data access must implement proper authorization, encryption, and audit logging. No feature shall compromise security for convenience.

### II. User-Centric Design
Every interface and workflow MUST be designed from the user's perspective. Features should be intuitive, accessible, and follow established UX patterns. Complex functionality should be hidden behind simple, clear interfaces.

### III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. All API endpoints, components, and business logic must have comprehensive test coverage.

### IV. API-First Development
Every feature MUST expose functionality via well-defined REST APIs. Frontend and backend must be loosely coupled through API contracts. All data operations must be accessible via API endpoints.

### V. Document-Centric Workflow
All features MUST revolve around document management and sharing. User workflows should prioritize document upload, organization, sharing, and access. Features not directly related to document management are secondary.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Process
- All PRs must pass automated tests and security scans
- Minimum 2 approvals required for production code
- Security-sensitive changes require security team review
- Documentation updates required for API changes

### Quality Gates
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ code coverage required
- **Integration Tests**: All user workflows must be tested
- **Security Tests**: Penetration testing for new features
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for high-traffic features

### Deployment Process
- **Staging**: All features must pass staging environment tests
- **Production**: Blue-green deployment with rollback capability
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and alerting required
- **Backup**: Automated daily backups with disaster recovery plan

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan.

All PRs/reviews must verify compliance. Complexity must be justified with clear business value. Use `.specify/templates/` for development guidance.
