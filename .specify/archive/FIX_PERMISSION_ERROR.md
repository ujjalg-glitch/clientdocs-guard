## üéØ Solution (Choose One)

### **Option 1: Quick Fix - Grant Super Admin to Current User** (Recommended)

1. **Find out which email you're logged in as**
   - Check the top-right of your app
   - Or check browser dev tools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí look for `sb-` cookies

2. **Run SQL in Supabase**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rlsdiyunttbhqdiesaeq/sql
   - Open file: `GRANT_SUPERADMIN_TO_CURRENT_USER.sql`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Replace `superadmin@clientdocs.com` with YOUR email on these lines:
     ```sql
     v_user_email TEXT := 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE'; -- Line 9
     WHERE u.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE' -- Line 68
     ```
   - Click **Run**
   - Should see: "‚úÖ SUCCESS! User ... now has super_admin access"

3. **Logout and Login Again**
   - Go to your app
   - Logout
   - Login with the same email
   - Try creating a user again

### **Option 2: Complete Database Reset** (If tables don't exist)

1. **Add Service Role Key First!** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   ```bash
   # In .env file, add:
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_key_from_supabase
   ```
   Get key from: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rlsdiyunttbhqdiesaeq/settings/api

2. **Run Complete Database Setup**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rlsdiyunttbhqdiesaeq/sql
   - Copy entire `DROP_AND_CREATE_DATABASE.sql`
   - Paste and click **Run**
   - This creates all tables, roles, permissions, and super admin user

3. **Create Super Admin in Supabase Auth**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rlsdiyunttbhqdiesaeq/auth/users
   - Click "Add user" ‚Üí "Create new user"
   - Email: `superadmin@clientdocs.com`
   - Password: `SuperAdmin123!`
   - Auto Confirm User: **‚úì Yes**
   - Click "Create user"

4. **Link Auth User to Database User**
   - Copy the user's UUID from Supabase Auth Users list
   - Run this SQL:
     ```sql
     UPDATE "User" 
     SET id = 'PASTE_UUID_HERE'
     WHERE email = 'superadmin@clientdocs.com';
     ```

5. **Restart Dev Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Login**
   - Email: `superadmin@clientdocs.com`
   - Password: `SuperAdmin123!`

## üîç Verify It's Working

### Test 1: Check Database
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if your user has super_admin role
SELECT 
  u.email,
  u.role,
  u."isActive"
FROM "User" u
WHERE u.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE';

-- Should show:
-- email: your@email.com
-- role: super_admin
-- isActive: true
```

### Test 2: Check Permissions
```sql
-- Check user's permissions
SELECT 
  u.email,
  p.name as permission,
  up.granted
FROM "User" u
JOIN user_permissions up ON up.user_id = u.id
JOIN permissions p ON p.id = up.permission_id
WHERE u.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE';

-- Should show all permissions granted
```

### Test 3: Try Creating a User
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/users/create`
2. Fill in the form
3. Click "Create User"
4. Should see: "User created successfully!" ‚úÖ

## üêõ Still Not Working?

### Debug Step 1: Check Auth User
```sql
-- Check if user exists in auth.users
SELECT id, email, role FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE';
```

### Debug Step 2: Check User Table
```sql
-- Check if user exists in User table
SELECT * FROM "User" 
WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE';
```

### Debug Step 3: Check User Roles
```sql
-- Check if user has roles assigned
SELECT 
  u.email,
  r.name as role_name
FROM "User" u
JOIN user_roles ur ON ur.user_id = u.id
JOIN roles r ON r.id = ur.role_id
WHERE u.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE';
```

### Debug Step 4: Check Tables Exist
```sql
-- Verify all tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN ('User', 'roles', 'permissions', 'user_roles', 'user_permissions', 'role_permissions');

-- Should return all 6 tables
```

## üìä Understanding the Error

### What Happened:
```
1. You clicked "Create User"
2. Frontend sent POST request to /api/admin/users
3. API checked: Is user authenticated? ‚úÖ Yes
4. API checked: Is user super_admin? ‚ùå No (not in database)
5. API checked: Does user have users.create permission? ‚ùå No
6. API returned: 403 Forbidden
```

### What Should Happen:
```
1. You click "Create User"
2. Frontend sends POST request to /api/admin/users
3. API checks: Is user authenticated? ‚úÖ Yes
4. API checks: Is user super_admin? ‚úÖ Yes (from database)
5. API allows: Super admins have all permissions
6. API creates user: ‚úÖ Success
```

**Guide**: See `FIX_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY.md`

### Issue 2: Database Not Set Up
**Error**: "relation 'User' does not exist"
