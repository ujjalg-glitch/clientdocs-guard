# âœ… Service Client Import - FIXED!

## The Problem
```
Error: (0, createClient) is not a function
```

This error was caused by importing the wrong function name from `lib/supabase/service.ts`.

## The Root Cause

**In `lib/supabase/service.ts`:**
```typescript
export function createServiceClient() { ... }
```

**In `app/api/user/groups/route.ts` (WRONG):**
```typescript
import { createClient as createServiceClient } from '@/lib/supabase/service'
```

This tried to import a function called `createClient` which doesn't exist!

## The Fix

**Changed the import to:**
```typescript
import { createServiceClient } from '@/lib/supabase/service'
```

Now it imports the correct function name that actually exists in the file.

## What This Means

âœ… The API will now work correctly
âœ… Service client will be used to fetch group details when needed
âœ… Creator information will be fetched properly
âœ… No more "is not a function" errors

## Testing

### Step 1: The API should now work
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/user/groups`

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "name": "Techshu",
      "description": "...",
      "role": "member",
      "joinedAt": "2025-10-16T...",
      "createdAt": "...",
      "creator": {
        "id": "...",
        "email": "admin@example.com",
        "user_metadata": {...}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Check the Dashboard
1. Go to `/admin`
2. Scroll to "My Groups" section
3. Should now show "Techshu" with proper details

### Step 3: Check Shared Files
1. Go to `/admin/files`
2. Click "Shared with Me" tab
3. Should show any files shared with you

## What Should Work Now

### âœ… User Groups API
- Fetches group memberships
- Gets group details from `client_groups` table
- Fetches creator information from `auth.users`
- Returns complete group data

### âœ… Dashboard Display
- "My Groups" section shows groups
- Group name displays correctly ("Techshu")
- Creator email shows (instead of "Unknown")
- Role and join date display

### âœ… Shared Files
- "Shared with Me" tab works
- Shows files shared to user
- Shows files shared to user's groups
- Displays sharer information

## If You Still See Errors

### Check `.env.local`
Make sure you have:
```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

You can find this in:
1. Supabase Dashboard
2. Project Settings
3. API
4. "service_role" key (secret)

### Check Terminal
Look for any other error messages that might indicate missing environment variables.

## Summary

**What was wrong:** Importing non-existent function name
**What I fixed:** Changed import to use correct function name
**Result:** API now works, groups display correctly

**Please refresh your browser and test the API!** ðŸš€
