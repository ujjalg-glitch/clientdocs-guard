# ✅ Member Management Fix - Complete!

## What Was Missing
You couldn't see or manage group members because the Client Groups page didn't have the member management UI.

## What I Fixed

### 1. Updated Client Groups Page
**File**: `app/admin/client-groups/page.tsx`

#### Added Features:
- ✅ **Manage Members Button** - Users icon (👥) in Actions column
- ✅ **Member Management Dialog** - Full interface for managing members
- ✅ **Add Member Section** - Dropdown to select and add users
- ✅ **Current Members List** - Table showing all group members
- ✅ **Remove Member Functionality** - X button to remove members
- ✅ **User Fetching** - Pulls available users from API
- ✅ **Real-time Updates** - Group refreshes after adding/removing members

#### New State Management:
```typescript
- manageMembersOpen - Controls dialog visibility
- selectedGroup - Currently selected group for member management
- availableUsers - List of users that can be added
- selectedUserId - Currently selected user in dropdown
- addingMember - Loading state for add operation
```

#### New Functions:
```typescript
- openManageMembers() - Opens dialog and loads users
- fetchAvailableUsers() - Fetches users from API
- handleAddMember() - Adds user to group
- handleRemoveMember() - Removes user from group
```

### 2. Fixed Member API Route
**File**: `app/api/client-groups/[id]/members/route.ts`

#### Changes:
- Changed DELETE method to accept `memberId` in request body (not query params)
- Updated query to use member ID for deletion
- Made it consistent with how the frontend sends data

**Before**:
```typescript
const userId = searchParams.get('userId')
.delete()
.eq('user_id', userId)
```

**After**:
```typescript
const { memberId } = await req.json()
.delete()
.eq('id', memberId)
```
