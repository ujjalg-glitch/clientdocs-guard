# üîß Storage & Share Dialog Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: "Bucket not found" Error
**Problem**: `{"statusCode":"404","error":"Bucket not found","message":"Bucket not found"}`

**Cause**: The Supabase storage bucket `documents` doesn't exist.

### Issue 2: Select Component Error  
**Problem**: `Error: A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string`

**Cause**: Select components had empty string values which are not allowed.

## Solutions

### ‚úÖ Fix 1: Create Storage Bucket

#### Step 1: Create Bucket in Supabase Dashboard
1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rlsdiyunttbhqdiesaeq
   - Go to **Storage** (left sidebar)

2. **Create New Bucket**
   - Click **"New bucket"**
   - **Name**: `documents`
   - **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ Check this (for easy testing)
   - Click **"Create bucket"**

#### Step 2: Run Storage Setup SQL
Run this in **SQL Editor**:
```sql
-- Add public access policy
CREATE POLICY "Public documents access"
ON storage.objects FOR ALL
USING (bucket_id = 'documents')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'documents');

-- Disable RLS for files table (development only)
ALTER TABLE "files" DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### ‚úÖ Fix 2: Select Component Values

**Fixed in ShareDialog**:
- Changed `value=""` to `value="never"` for "Never" option
- Changed `value=""` to `value="no-group"` for "No group" option
- Updated logic to handle new values properly

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create Storage Bucket (Required)
```
Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí New bucket ‚Üí Name: "documents" ‚Üí Public ‚úÖ ‚Üí Create

-- Copy and paste this in SQL Editor
CREATE POLICY "Public documents access"
ON storage.objects FOR ALL
USING (bucket_id = 'documents')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'documents');

ALTER TABLE "files" DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
