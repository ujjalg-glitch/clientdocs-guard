# ✅ Shared Files & Group Memberships FIXED!

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Shared Files Not Showing
**Problem**: Files shared with users through groups were not appearing in their dashboard.

**Cause**: Dashboard only showed files uploaded by the user (`uploaded_by = user.id`), not files shared with them.

### Issue 2: Group Memberships Not Displayed
**Problem**: Users added to groups couldn't see their group memberships in the dashboard.

**Cause**: No UI component to display user's group memberships.

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ Fix 1: Created Shared Files API
**File**: `app/api/files/shared/route.ts`

New API endpoint that fetches files shared with the current user:
- **Direct shares**: Files shared directly with the user
- **Group shares**: Files shared with groups the user belongs to
- **Complete metadata**: Includes sharer info, group info, share settings

```typescript
// Query logic
.or(`shared_with.eq.${user.id},client_group_id.in.(
  select group_id from group_members where user_id = '${user.id}'
)`)
```

### ✅ Fix 2: Enhanced Dashboard Files Page
**File**: `app/dashboard/files/page.tsx`

Added tabbed interface with:
- **"My Files" tab**: Files uploaded by the user (existing functionality)
- **"Shared with Me" tab**: Files shared through groups (NEW!)

**New Features**:
- Tab navigation between own files and shared files
- Different table columns for shared files
- Shows who shared the file and which group
- Respects view-only settings
- Direct access to shared links

### ✅ Fix 3: Created User Groups API
**File**: `app/api/user/groups/route.ts`

API endpoint to fetch user's group memberships:
- Lists all groups user is a member of
- Shows role, join date, group creator
- Includes group descriptions

### ✅ Fix 4: Added User Groups Component
**File**: `components/dashboard/user-groups.tsx`

New dashboard component that displays:
- **Group name and description**
- **User's role in the group**
- **Group creator information**
- **Join date**
- **Empty state** when no memberships

### ✅ Fix 5: Updated Main Dashboard
**File**: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

Added UserGroups component to the main dashboard:
- Shows group memberships prominently
- Helps users understand their access level
- Provides context for shared files

## How It Works Now

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Share Files with Groups
1. **Create a client group** at `/admin/client-groups`
2. **Add users** to the group
3. **Upload a file** at `/admin/upload`
4. **Share the file** with the group
5. **Login as group member**
6. **Check dashboard** - file should appear in "Shared with Me" tab

### Test 2: View Group Memberships
1. **Add user to group** (as admin)
2. **Login as that user**
3. **Check main dashboard** - should see "My Groups" section
4. **Verify group info** - name, role, join date

### Test 3: Access Shared Files
1. **Go to "Shared with Me" tab** in Files page
2. **Click View button** - should open file
3. **Click Download** (if not view-only)
4. **Click Share button** - should open shared link
