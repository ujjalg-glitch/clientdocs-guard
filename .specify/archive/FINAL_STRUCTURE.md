# ✅ Final Application Structure

## 🎯 Simple & Clean Structure

### **One Dashboard for Everyone: `/admin`**
- ❌ No separate `/dashboard` route
- ✅ `/admin` is the main dashboard for ALL users
- ✅ Sidebar shows different options based on role

---

## 🗺️ Route Structure

### **Public Routes**
- `/` - Landing page
- `/auth/login` - Login page
- `/auth/register` - Register page

### **Protected Routes** (All under `/admin`)
- `/admin` - Main dashboard (ALL users)
- `/admin/files` - My files (ALL users)
- `/admin/upload` - Upload files (ALL users)
- `/admin/settings` - Settings (ALL users)
- `/admin/users` - User management (ADMIN only)

- `/admin/roles` - Role management (ADMIN only)
- `/admin/roles/create` - Create role (ADMIN only)
- `/admin/permissions` - Permission management (ADMIN only)

## 👥 User Experience by Role

### **Regular User** (role = 'user')
**Sidebar Shows:**
- ✅ Dashboard
- ✅ My Files (only their uploads)
- ✅ Upload
- ✅ Settings

**Can Access:**
- ✅ View dashboard
- ✅ Upload files
- ✅ View their own files
- ✅ Download their files
- ❌ Cannot see other users' files
- ❌ Cannot access Users/Roles/Permissions

### **Admin** (role = 'admin' or 'super_admin')
**Sidebar Shows:**
- ✅ Dashboard
- ✅ My Files (all files)
- ✅ Upload
- ✅ Settings
- ✅ Users (admin section)
- ✅ Roles (admin section)
- ✅ Permissions (admin section)

**Can Access:**
- ✅ Everything regular users can
- ✅ View all files (not just their own)
- ✅ Manage users (create, edit, delete)
- ✅ Manage roles
- ✅ Manage permissions

---

## 🔐 Permission Logic

### **Simple & Frontend-Based**

```typescript
// Check user role from database
const role = await getCurrentUserRole() // Returns: 'user', 'admin', or 'super_admin'

// Show/hide features
if (role === 'admin' || role === 'super_admin') {
  // Show admin features
} else {
  // Show user features only
}
```

### **No Server-Side Permission Checks**
- Server only checks: Is user logged in?
- Frontend checks: What is user's role?
- Simple, clean, easy to understand

---

## 📂 Files Access Logic

### **For Regular Users**
```sql
SELECT * FROM files 
WHERE uploaded_by = current_user_id
```

### **For Admins**
```sql
SELECT * FROM files
-- See all files
```

---

## 🔄 Login/Register Flow

```
User visits /auth/login
  ↓
Enters credentials
  ↓
Clicks Login
  ↓
Redirects to /admin
  ↓
Sees dashboard with role-appropriate navigation
```

---

## 🎨 UI Components

### **Shared Components**
- `AdminShell` - Main layout wrapper
- `AdminHeader` - Page headers
- `AdminNav` - Sidebar navigation (role-aware)
- `UserNav` - User dropdown menu

### **Permission Components**
- `PermissionGuard` - Protect routes (frontend)
- `getCurrentUserRole()` - Get user role from database
- `canAccessAdmin()` - Check if user is admin

---

## 📊 Database Tables

### **Minimal Required Tables**

1. **User** - User accounts
   ```sql
   id, email, name, role, isActive
   ```

2. **files** - File metadata
   ```sql
   id, filename, original_name, uploaded_by, created_at
   ```

3. **roles** (Optional - for UI only)
   ```sql
   id, name, description
   ```

4. **permissions** (Optional - for UI only)
   ```sql
   id, name, resource, action
   ```

---

## ✅ What Works

- ✅ Single dashboard route (`/admin`)
- ✅ Role-based navigation
- ✅ Regular users see their files
- ✅ Admins see all files
- ✅ Login/Register redirect to `/admin`
- ✅ Simple permission logic
- ✅ No complex server checks

---

## 🚀 Testing
